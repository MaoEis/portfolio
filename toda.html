            Toda, an exciting new app that makes fashion more sustainable by
            allowing you to share your special clothing with friends. Upload a
            photo of your item, add a description and choose who can see and
            borrow it.

              In a world of fast fashion, we buy expensive outfits for special
              events but only wear them once. We love having something new for
              each occasion, yet we hang onto clothes we’re attached to but
              don’t really wear anymore.

              Instead of buying new outfits you'll only wear once, you can
              easily share your existing clothing with friends through Toda.
              This way, you keep your wardrobe fresh, reduce waste, and make
              fashion more sustainable.

          The assignment was given by Thomas More. We were individually asked to
          create an application that can help boost sustainability in fashion.
          <br />
          <br />
          In this assignment we were asked to do our research on sustainable
          fashion, create a solution based up on the research. We had to design
          a landingspage and the application. Further we were asked to make
          paflets and a selling pitch.
